**[YOOT INTERNSHIP PROJECT]**

**[PROGRESS]**
- User can add item from home to cart.
- User can change quality of item or delete an item from cart
- The price will be calculate dynamically
- Change address for the order

**[BACKLOG]**
- Home and cart are both listening from real time database (bandwitch consuming)
- Should upgrade project to Redux to manage global state easier (Cart) and avoid loading from database continously
- Add some modal for the UI/UX
- Request to restaurant and discount code
